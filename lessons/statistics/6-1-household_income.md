[Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2007.html#toc60) (household income)

#### Compute the median, mean, skewness and Pearsonâ€™s skewness of the resulting sample. What fraction of households reports a taxable income below the mean? How do the results depend on the assumed upper bound?

>> #### median and mean
Mean(sample), Median(sample)
>> #### skewness
Skewness(sample), PearsonMedianSkewness(sample)

>> cdf.Prob(Mean(sample))
#### About 66% of the population makes less than the mean

>> The results depend on the assumed upper bound becuase it affects the mean and the skewness of the distribution.
